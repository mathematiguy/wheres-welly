# For Users
Wellington is a complicated city. Threaded with narrow, winding roads and tunnels looping through hilly terrain, it can be difficult for new-comers (and old timers!) to wrap their heads around the cities, suburbs and the connections inbetween. 

Where's Wally is a tool to help current and prospective Wellingtonians plan where to live and explore in the windy city. If you are planning on moving in for work, and need somewhere close to the CBD, you can use Where's Wally to help you find where is best for you.

We set out to save people from the pain we’ve experienced when buying, renting and booking accommodation in Wellington.

We love Wellington [photo of hat]  but it’s weird.[Wellington is Weird board on video]

  [Gerrymander picture - stokes valley carrot]

Due to its hills, layout, and public transport quirks things can be further away or closer than they seem. [images of Wellington, still face of Mckayla Maroney face]

Using the APIs from HERE  [HERE HOME PAGES]

and several open data sets from MBIE, [Screen cap] Stats.NZ and Data.govt.nz [Screen cap Data.govt.nz]  

 we’ve created a tool that lets you pick a spot on the map and see everywhere you can get to within 5, 10, or 15 minutes.  [image, see it in work]

You can filter by mode of transport, [show the thing]

 time of day, [show the thing]

day of the week. [show the thing]

We also provide a layer of resources which you can switch on/off to see what destinations you can reach.

[Rachel- house buyer] I’ve [been trying to buy a house in Wellington and] spent hours on google maps searching travel times for properties, and even longer driving to Open Homes.  

[Which is closer:Tawa or Johnsonville? [picture standing at the station looking up] 
Ohiro Bay or Kilbirnie [picture] ? 
Wainuiomata or Eastbourne?]  
Where the well do you want to live?  [image #dadjoke]
The answers may surprise you.  

Current sites don’t let you search by commuting times 

Some places that look good on a map actually suck to commute from [show images]. 

 And other places [Tawa] are underrated - and with house prices increasing fast, learning this too late is expensive [sad face Rachel looking at auction costs]. 

[Renter] I’ve made the mistake of renting where I thought was close to town: only to find that buses didn’t run in the weekend [look at bus stop] - no after work movies or dance classes for me.  

Our tool also can help with:
Visitors to Wellington booking their accommodation [ask backpacker to use outside station
Renters new to town who don’t have a car
Retirees wanting to live where they don’t have to drive [
Planning exercise routes [someone dressed for jogging]
And in law enforcement [cops and robbers?]

Future development goals include:
Better capturing public transport options 
Adding more layers of services
Building on the happiness and self-assessed health scores from the Human Health Survey 
Adjusting the scale to match commuting preferences
Integrating with existing rental and house sales websites so that their information is more useful.
